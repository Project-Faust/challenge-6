# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## How does it work?
This week's project utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API, eventListeners to allow the user to click on buttons (both a search button and search history buttons to recall past searches), localStorage to store data from past searches as well as render buttons to the page, traversing the API objects and results once converted into usable data via JSON, JavaScript to utilize these tools as well as append elements to the HTML code, and some base HTML and CSS to create a functional and easy-to-view web application.

## How do I use it?
The user, upon navigating to the page, is given a search form in which they are to type the name of a city about which they would like to view the current and upcoming weather forecast. Upon clicking the search button after typing in a city name, the user will see separate elements have been populated to the page regarding the current day's forecast as well as that of each of the following four days for a five-day forecast. After a result is found, a button is then created, giving the user a search history, that can also be clicked on to call an updated search for the corresponding city that has been previously searched. Local storage allows the user to see the search history even upon closing the browser or refreshing the page.
